    <h1>Raster plot</h1>
    <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
    <p>
      States which have more annual rain are more likely to have fewer car accidents.
    </p>  
    <p>The idea behind this is that, places where there is more rain will make people ride more carefully and slowly since they know the road
      is wet and gets very slippery </p>
  <div id="vis"></div>
  <p>
    To try and demonstrate this matter more. I chose from 3 different "areas". High rain, dry, medium rain areas.
  </p>
  WA and OR are got high annual precipitation MA and VA got medium precipitation. AZ though is I guess from the raster the most dry state and it got most of the traffic fatalities.
  <p>
    <div id = "bar"></div>
    <p>
      I chose those states because they are very close in terms of population.<br> Of course there are other states where there is more accidents with more population, <br> but I think taking this experiment from similar states in term of population could give us a decent look on the tendency I am looking for.
